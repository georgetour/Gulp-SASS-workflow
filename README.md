# Gulp-SASS-workflow
This is a project that uses NPM, Gulp and SASS so we can optimize our workflow. It will help new developers to learn to work with these tools.

#### Requirements : Very good level in HTML and CSS, basic understanding of javascript

Gulp is a tool that helps with workflow automation since it does a lot of tasks for us like minification, concatination, browser refresh when we have changes and many more...

SASS is a preprocessor that makes CSS really powerful since you can have variables, mixin, partial, nesting, arguments, create grid responsive layouts and other cool stuff that will improve your CSS code amazingly.

## Installation and starting

First we install git so we can monitor our project's version :

 https://git-scm.com/download/win

 Then we install node.js :

https://nodejs.org/en/

We can check version of node by typing in command prompt :

<code>node -v</code>

Package manager version in command prompt

<code>npm -v</code>

Then to install gulp we type :

<code>npm install -g gulp</code>

We create a new repository to github.com with our account and then we clone.

Go to the directory you want to clone our repository with command prompt :

<code>git clone URL FROM OUR repository</code>

To create or reinitialize git :

<code>git init</code>

We need to create a package.json that will contain all our dependencies

<code>npm init

To start adding changes to your git (m stads for message)

<code>git commit -a -m "Add package.json"</code>

And we push the changes

<code>git push
